## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0BFFF) to convey a sense of calm and accessibility. The intent here is that a media tool shouldn't necessarily look techy or corporate.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F7F5FF), nearly white, for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Pale violet-blue (#B4C4FF) to complement the primary color and add visual interest to key interactive elements. This offers some but not too much differentiation from the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, known for its clarity and readability on screens. 
- Use simple, outlined icons for clarity. Icons related to downloads, audio, and video formats.
- Clean and spacious layout. Prioritize a linear flow from URL input to audio download.
- Subtle transitions and animations during the audio generation process.
